Hey everyone, for the code to run on the machine, you need to have java 11 installed on your computer 
and install the Chromedriver compatible with your browser version, 
in addition you need to go to the Constants class and change the path where your Chromedriver is.
Any question? Let me know, in my email address: jeferssonlima4@hotmail.com!
